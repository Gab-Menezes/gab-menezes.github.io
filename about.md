## Name: Gabriel

I'm 23 years old developer from Brazil, mostly focused on writing Rust. I'm not scared of unsafe and will do everything in my power to be performant, mostly throught SIMD and smart algos. I also enjoy Information Retrival.

If you are asking yourself, "why this looks so dog shit ?", the reason is that I can't combine two colors, so imagine working is HTML and CSS... The current design is more than enough to express my ideas.
